types of muscle ~A:~ skeletal, cardiac, smooth
skeletal muscle ~A:~ links most of our bones, polynucleated cell - single muscle cell with many nuclei
cardiac muscle ~A:~ involuntary muscle, ex: heart
smooth muscle ~A:~ involuntary muscle, ex: lines gut, blood vessels
muscle fiber ~A:~ single muscle cell, composed of myofibril
Myofibril ~A:~ made of group of sarcomeres, surrounded by T-tubules, structure that contracts
sarcomeres ~A:~ made of group of proteins put together that contract making the cell and then the muscle contract, made of thick and thin fibers
motor unit ~A:~ alpha motor neuron + muscle fiber it innervates
large motor units ~A:~ made of many muscle fibers. larger muscles with smaller range of motion
smaller motor units ~A:~ few muscle fibers. allow fine motor control
stimulation of muscles ~A:~ stimulate one motor neuron to stimulate the fibers inside a muscle
neuromuscular junction ~A:~ point of synaptic contact between the axon terminal of a motor neuron and the muscle fiber it controls
muscle/motor twitch ~A:~ single muscle activation (constant activation of group of muscles = no twitching)
neuromuscular junction activation process ~A:~ 1. motor neuron fires AP 2. releases Ach 3. binds Ach to ionotropic receptors 4. Na+ enters via channels 5. muscle fiber depolarizes 6. gated Na+ opens 7. muscle fiber fires AP
sarcoplasmic reticulum (net) ~A:~ where Ca2+ is stored; calcium is needed to contract the muscle
T-tubules (electric fence) ~A:~ membrane that surrounds the myofibril/component of a muscle cell and enters in little tube like structures, contracts muscle at the same time everywhere
thick filament (sarcomere) ~A:~ myosin
thin filament (sarcomere) ~A:~ actin, troponin, tropomyosin
Sarcomere contraction ~A:~ when thick and thin filaments contract
muscle contraction ~A:~ Muscle cell always stores Calcium in sarcoplasmic reticulum (through pump). Muscle relaxes when no calcium is present
voluntary actions ~A:~ movements accompanied by a conscious awareness of waht we are doing and our attention is direction toward the action or its purpose (scratch nose)
involuntary actions ~A:~ movements that are unconscious, automatic, or a reflex (heart beating)
motor neurons ~A:~ located in ventral horn, innervate muscles
ventral horn ~A:~ located in spinal cord, contains motor neurons that affect axial muscles, cell bodies of alpha motor neurons located in ventral horn
alpha motor neurons ~A:~ large lower motor neurons of the brain stem and spinal cord that innervate muscle fibers of skeletal muscles
motor neuron pool ~A:~ alpha motor neurons that innervate single muscle
muscle spindles (stretch receptors) ~A:~ specialized structure that contains several types of skeletal muscle fibers within most skeletal muscles
proprioreceptors ~A:~ receptors that are a component of the somatic sensory system that informs us how our body is positioned and moving in space
1a axons ~A:~ thickest myelinated axons that conduct AP very rapidly, enter the spinal cord via the dorsal roots --> form excitatory synapses on alpha motor neurons
myotatic reflex (stretch reflex) ~A:~ (knee jerk) motor neurons receive sensory feedback from the muscle, discharges 1a sensory axon and alpha motor neuron it acts on, muscle stretched discharge rate increase, muscles shortened discharge rate decreases
gamma motor neurons ~A:~ innervate intrafusal fibers, adjust the set point of muscles
1b sensory axons ~A:~ slightly smaller than 1a axons that innervate muscle spindles
muscle spindles ~A:~ sensitive to changes in muscle length (1a activity)
Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gerig) ~A:~ caused by degeneration of the alpha motor neurons and their input from the cortex
Myasthenia Gravis ~A:~ the Ach is released at the neuromuscular junction fails to consistently elicit an AP in the muscle fiber because the body is making antibodies against the Ach receptors

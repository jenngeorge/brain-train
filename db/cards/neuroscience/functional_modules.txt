lower motor control level ~A:~ (BSS) brain stem, spinal cord, sensory receptors
Middle motor control level ~A:~ (BCTB): Basal nuclei, cerebellum, thalamus, brain stem
Basal nuclei ~A:~ involved in motor function and cognitive abilities, gating movement function --> start/stop movement
cerebellum ~A:~ 10% of total volume of brain, controls fine movement, balance, coordination, muscle tone, motor learning
thalamus ~A:~ relay center
brain stem ~A:~ basic autmatic functions (posture)
highest motor control level ~A:~ frontal cortex
frontal cortex ~A:~ where you make a decision to move with a particular goal
Area 4 ~A:~ M1, primary motor cortex
Area 6 ~A:~ SMA, PMA, higher motor area
Premotor area (PMA) ~A:~ neurons in this area are selectively active well before movements are initiated, cells start responding after the cue appears before the movement starts, encodes intention to perform movement
Supplementary motor area (SMA) ~A:~ actions from memory, SMA neurons are more active when performing a sequence already learned
Primary motor cortex (M1) ~A:~ codes the initiation and execution of movement, neurons in M1 can represent multiple attributes of the movement (direction and force)
mirror neurons ~A:~ located everywhere, respond to: 1. preparation for execution of particular movement 2. when same action is being performed by another individual
Basal Ganglia (COVES) ~A:~ Cognitive functions, Oculomotor Functions, Voluntary Movement, Emotional Functions, Skeletomotor Functions
striatum ~A:~ caudate nucleus, putamen
golbus pallidus ~A:~ external, internal
subthalamic nucleu ~A:~ located under the thalamus
substantia nigra ~A:~ a midbrain structure that is reciprocally connected with the basal ganglia of the forebrain
pars compacta ~A:~ source of dopamine within the motor system, inhibitory to GPi
pars reticulata ~A:~ regulates eye movement
Basal Ganglia ~A:~ main function is in motor control: gating initiation and termination of movements
Inhibitory basal ganglia structures ~A:~ Globus Pallidus External, Globus Pallidus Internal, Striatum, Substantia Nigra - Pars Reticulata
Excitatory basal ganglia structures ~A:~ Subthalamic Nucleus, Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta
Globus Pallidus internal ~A:~ always active and inhibitory; constantly inhibiting the thalamus, prevents it from activating the cortex which is necessary for the final movement loop *as long as GPi is active we can NOT move
cerebellar cortex areas ~A:~ spinocerebellum, cerebrocerebellum, vestibulocerebellum
spinocerebellum ~A:~ receives input from the spinal cord, body and limb movements
cerebrocerebellum ~A:~ receives input from cortex, planning movement and evaluating sensory information for action
vestibulocerebellum ~A:~ receives input from the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem; involved in posture, equilibrium (balance), and eye-movements
function of cerebellum ~A:~ motor learning, it allows us to get better at a particular task by practicing
temporal lobe contains: ~A:~ temporal cortex: site of longer termmemory storage/ hippocampus
inferotemporal cortex (area IT) ~A:~ higher-order visual area in the inferior temporal lobe. lesion impairs discrimination. visual area and area involved in memory storage. has fusiform face area
declarative memory location ~A:~ hippocampus
working memory location ~A:~ prefrontal cortex
emotional memory location ~A:~ amygdala
procedural memory location ~A:~ basal ganglia

a subdiscipline of psychology, is concerned with cognitive structures and processes. The domain of cognition ranges very widely. ~A:~ Cognitive psychology
the formation of a mental representation of the stimulus situation. Information must be extracted from the stimulus, and then combined with information retrieved from memory. This process is sometimes known as impression formation. ~A:~ Social perception
concerns the acquisition, storage, and retrieval of social knowledge. Social memory is often studied in the form of person memory, or our memory for the characteristics and behaviors of other people. ~A:~ Social memory
nonsocial domain, memory is often classified as declarative or procedural, episodic or semantic. The same classifications can apply in the social domain. Person memory is episodic memory about other people, while autobiographical memory is episodic memory about oneself. ~A:~ memory types
an appreciation that others have beliefs and mental states that may differ from the child's own. In this sense, the theory of mind is essentially social in nature. ~A:~ theory of mind - child development
perception: we go 'beyond the information given' by the stimulus to construct a mental representation of the environment based on inferences from world-knowledge (JS Bruner) <br> memory: reconstruct events -- again, based as much on inference than on retrieval (FC Bartlett) <br> cognition = creating reality ~A:~ Social Constructivism: perception/memory
Individuals create the reality to which they respond, by processes such as the self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, a person who believes that another person is hostile may behave in such a manner as to elicit hostile behavior from that person. ~A:~ Cognitive constructivism
larger social entities also create reality, through the exercise of collective intentionality. For example, money and marriage are real things; but they exist only because people bring them into existence through acts of thought ~A:~ Social constructivism
social cognition blurs the distinction between subject and object. In nonsocial cognition, there is the subject -- the one who does the perceiving, or remembering, or thinking; and there is the object -- the thing that is perceived, remembered, or thought. But when we think of ourselves, we are simultaneously knower and the object of knowledge ~A:~ social vs nonsocial cognition difference
E Goffman on intelligence transaction: I'm trying to fool you. You realize that I'm trying to fool you, and I -- realizing that -- try to fool you into thinking that I don't realize that you have realized that I am trying to fool you. Goffman argues that at each turn in the game the parties seek out more and more specific and reliable cues to the other's intentions. But that search for specificity and reliability only makes the problem worse. ~A:~ expression game.
mind was made of an immaterial substance: humans have minds, animals operate soley by physiological mechanisms like the reflex ~A:~ Descartes' substance dualism
detailed the psychological principles by which visual perception operated, in the context of the principles of physiology and the physical laws of optic; measured speed of a neural impulse ~A:~ Physiological Optics (1856-1867), Helmholtz
an experimental, quantitative psychology had to be limited to `immediate` experience, by which he meant sensation and perception. ~A:~ Wundt
pioneered `mental measurement`, pertaining to elementary sensory and perceptual functions, and reaction time, and developed techniques of regression and correlation (1886). ~A:~ Galton (1883)
Naturwissenschaft, Geisteswissenschaft, Volkerpsycholgie ~A:~ Wundt's distinctions in social psych
attributed the individual's behavior in a particular situation to his beliefs about that situation ~A:~ Theodore Newcomb
`the free inner man who is held responsible for the behavior of the external biological organism is only a prescientific substitute for the kinds of causes which are discovered in the course of a scientific analysis. All these alternative causes lie outside the individual` ~A:~ Skinner - Doctrine of Situationism
